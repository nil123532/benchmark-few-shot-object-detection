Relaxed setting
Progressively relaxed both way.
Why upper limit increases? To accommodate for class that cannot 
reach 30 shots because there exists too many shots. 
Why lower limit decreases? To accommodate for class that cannot 
reach 30 shots because thee exists too few shots. [not applicable for 1 shots]

How to progressively relax?
upper_limit = shots + relaxed // upper limit 
lower_limit = shots - relaxed // lower limit 

if (sample_shots + temp > upper_limit) || (sample_shots + temp < lower_limit)
	continue 

//rest of code

if (sample_shots < upper_limit) && (sample_shots > lower_limit)
	break
